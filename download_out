# I'm collecting ccache for all ROMs that I build inorder to speed up all future updates that I will release for those ROMs.
# So when a new build will upload ccache, it should not overwrite the ccache i saved for another ROM!
# Therefore, I'm using the branch on which Cirrus CI is running to rename the ccache.tar files before uploading them.
# For e.g, if Cirrus CI is running on branch "sakura_arm64", the compressed ccache will be renamed to "sakura_arm64_out.tar.gz" and uploaded.
# The upload_ccache script will be amended as needed to properly extract the ccache to the right folder.
CCACHE_FILE="$CIRRUS_BRANCH""_out.tar.gz"

# METHOD 1: Download using aria2c:
# Where ccache is located, use your own if you don't want to use my "prebuilt ccaches" xD
# cd /tmp
# url=https://ccache.chatur27.workers.dev/$CCACHE_FILE
# time aria2c $url -x16 -s50 # Using aria2c for speed haha, ccache will be at /tmp/$CCACHE_FILE

# METHOD 2: Download using Google Drive direcly (I have a premium account..HAHA):
time rclone copy aosp:$CCACHE_FILE /tmp/rom/
cd /tmp/rom # Where out has been downloaded


mv $CCACHE_FILE out.tar.gz # Rename back to original folder name before extracting
time tar xf out.tar.gz  # Extract ccache so ci can use it
rm -rf out.tar.gz # Remove unnecessary downloaded file, it will speed up the upload out process
